Control Audio and Video with Arduino and Processing
This is my first embeded Arduino + Processing experience. 

Brief
The application was designed to control audio and video, handled by Proccesing script over a MQTT protocol.
The application has been featured with custom control dashboard to have the chance of control the files like "play", "pause",
"stop" and "rewind", also "volume" can be controlled.

The Arduino code was written for a Wemos-D1. It collects information from four ultrasonic sensors, which two are attached 
to "sala_1" topic meanwhile left two sensors are attached to "sala_2" topic.

Behavior
When the object is in range of sensors this send the message to related topic over the network.
Both applications of proccesing should be attached to same network to hear messages and take actions if its needed.

Notes
As many must know, Wemos-D1 runs with 3,3Vcc, follow that and after several research, trigger and echo pins of HC-RS04 can 
be taken quite easy by the Wemos. Also was featured with a DO trough an optocoupler PC187.

Enjoy it.
